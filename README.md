# PYTHON-BASICS.-
# 🐍 Python Basics – Week 1

Welcome to my Week 1 Python learning log!  
This repo includes my first steps into Python, focusing on the basics like variables, data types, and simple input/output.

---

## 📘 Topics Covered
- Variables and assignment
- Basic data types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`)
- Type conversion (e.g., `int()`, `float()`, `str()`)
- Input/output using `input()` and `print()`
- Arithmetic and comparison operators

## 💻 Files
| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `variables.py` | Examples of creating and using variables |
| `user_input.py` | Simple scripts with `input()` and `print()` |
| `calculator.py` | A basic arithmetic calculator |
| `type_conversion.py` | Practice converting between data types |

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Python is dynamically typed, so I don’t need to declare data types explicitly.
- `input()` always returns a string — I need to convert it for math!
- Simple print formatting can make scripts feel more polished.

## 🔍 Sample Output (from calculator.py)
```bash
Enter first number: 10  
Enter second number: 5  
Select operation (+, -, *, /): *  
Result: 10 * 5 = 50
